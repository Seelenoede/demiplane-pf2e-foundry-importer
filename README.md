A basic import tool to allow the import of character sheet PDFs, that were generated by the Pathfinder Nexus on Demiplane, into Foundry VTT.

This is definitely inspired by kobseryqum/foundry-pathbuilder2e-import and also chrpow/shadowdark-pdf-importer.

This is still in the prototype phase. The mapping should be considered untested and unfinished. Do not use as is. I will create a release tag once I can import most data that I want. Then I will also deal with versioning, so do not trust the versioning in the module.json.
